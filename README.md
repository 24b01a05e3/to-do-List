The To-Do List Application is a console-based task management system developed using Python that helps users organize and manage their daily activities efficiently.
The application provides a simple, interactive, and user-friendly menu that allows users to perform essential task management operations such as adding tasks, viewing tasks, and deleting tasks.

This project is designed to strengthen fundamental programming skills and demonstrates the practical use of Python concepts including lists for data storage, loops for continuous program execution, conditional statements for decision-making, and functions for modular code structure.
By interacting with the application through the terminal, users can understand how real-world applications handle user input and process data logically.

The program runs in a continuous loop until the user chooses to exit, ensuring smooth navigation and uninterrupted task management.
Each task is stored dynamically during runtime, allowing flexible task handling without predefined limits.
